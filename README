NAME
    DBIx::TempDB - Create a temporary database

VERSION
    0.01

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::TempDB is a module which allow you to create a temporary database,
    which only lives as long as your process is alive. This can be very
    convenient when you want to run tests in parallel, without messing up
    the state between tests.

    This module currently support PostgreSQL and MySQL by installing the
    optional modules DBD::Pg and/or DBD::mysql. Let me know if you want
    another database to be supported.

    This module is currently EXPERIMENTAL. That means that if any major
    design flaws have been made, they will be fixed without warning.

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::More;
      use DBIx::TempDB;
      use DBI;

      # create a temp database
      my $tmpdb = DBIx::TempDB->new("postgresql://postgres@localhost");

      # print complete url to db server with database name
      diag $tmpdb->url;

      # connect to the temp database
      my $db = DBI->connect($tmpdb->dsn);

      # run tests...

      done_testing;
      # database is cleaned up when test exit

METHODS
  create_database
      $self = $self->create_database;

    This method will create a temp database for the current process. Calling
    this method multiple times will simply do nothing.

    The database name generated is subject for change, but currently it
    looks like something like this: "tmp_${UID}_${0}_${HOSTNAME}".

  dsn
      ($dsn, $user, $pass, $attrs) = $self->dsn;

    Will parse "url" and return a list of arguments suitable for "connect"
    in DBI.

    Note that this method cannot be called before "create_database" is
    called.

  new
      $self = DBIx::TempDB->new($url, %args);
      $self = DBIx::TempDB->new("mysql://127.0.0.1");
      $self = DBIx::TempDB->new("postgresql://postgres@db.example.com");

    Creates a new object after checking the $url is valid. %args can be:

    *   auto_create

        "create_database" will be called automatically, unless "auto_create"
        is set to a false value.

  url
      $url = $self->url;

    Returns the input URL as URL object, with path set to the temp database
    name.

    Note that this method cannot be called before "create_database" is
    called.
